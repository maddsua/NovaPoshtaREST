# Typings and functional interface for Nova Poshta (Нова Пошта) REST API

This package provides typing and functions to call Nova Poshta api methods.

Currently supporting NodeJS in ESM mode. Actually, Deno too, but we need to get rid of node-fetch for it.

Official API references are here: https://developers.novaposhta.ua/documentation

\* npm package and Deno module will be available when all API models will be implemented
